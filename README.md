# Leads Management

- Will be deployed to Vercel, link provided here:

https://alma-test-task.vercel.app/

- I have used Supabase as database and auth provider
- Won't run locally without the API keys, I can provide them if needed
- Implemented:
  - Next.js (including APIs)
  - Supabase as a DB
  - Authentication
  - Validation using Zod and React-Hook-Form
  - State management with Redux Toolkit (sorting and searching the leads on the client side)
  - CSS modules for styling
- Tried to manage SSR with client components
- In terms of architecture, didn't change much, relied heavily on opinionated Next.js recommendations
